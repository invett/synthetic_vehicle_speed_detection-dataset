## Introduction

---

This is a synthetic dataset built to develop an intelligent speed detection system. This dataset has been generated with the Carla Simulator, and has sequences recorded from a single point of view, with a camera centered on the road at a height of 3 meters, with an inclination of 45 degrees.
